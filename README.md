## Introduction

Professional with 15+ years delivering highly available, secure, and automated cloud platforms across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Expert at designing Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, CloudFormation) and containerized microservices (Kubernetes, Docker), paired with robust CI/CD automation (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps). 

Proven track record of embedding DevSecOps practices SAST, DAST (Veracode, Mend / WhiteSource, SonarQube), SBOMs, and policy-as-codeâ€”to shift security left and accelerate delivery. 
Deep experience in observability (Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic), Linux systems administration, and configuration management (Ansible, Chef). Seeking to drive platform reliability, compliance, and continuous improvement in an SRE, DevSecOps, or Cloud Engineering leadership role.

## Work Experience
- Current: (Jan/25) - Canopy Software Global provider of secure and scalable software solutions. I lead initiatives to build and optimize cloud-native infrastructure and DevOps pipelines that support high-scale application delivery. I focus on infrastructure automation, container orchestration, observability, and performance optimization to ensure highly available and secure environments.

* Key Achievements:*
Cloud Infrastructure & Automation: Designed and managed AWS environments using Terraform, enforcing Infrastructure-as-Code principles and automating resource provisioning.
Container Orchestration & Auto-Scaling: Deployed and maintained services on Amazon EKS with Kubernetes, integrating KEDA-based auto-scaling for responsive load handling.
CI/CD Automation: Built and maintained deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions, enabling fast, secure, and traceable delivery processes.
Observability & Monitoring: Implemented Elasticsearch-based monitoring and logging solutions, increasing operational visibility and reducing MTTR through enhanced telemetry.
Messaging & Data Layer Reliability: Tuned and operated MongoDB and RabbitMQ stacks for resilience and performance under heavy workloads.
Scripting & Automation: Developed Python-based automation tools to streamline routine tasks, improve system consistency, and reduce operational toil.
	Technologies: 
AWS, Terraform, EKS, Kubernetes, KEDA, GitHub Actions, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Python e Linux.
